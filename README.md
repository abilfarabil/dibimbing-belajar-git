# Git and Python Project for Reading CSV Files

## Project Description
This repository was created as part of the assignment in the Data Engineer Bootcamp, aimed at practicing the use of Git, from repository creation, branching, committing, to pull requests. Additionally, this repository also contains a Python file for reading the provided CSV file.

## Files in the Repository
1. **username.csv**: The CSV file provided for the assignment.
2. **read_csv.py**: A Python script that contains a function to read and display the contents of the CSV file.
